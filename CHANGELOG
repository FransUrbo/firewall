  - Option to add additional networks to masquerade

* 20061111
  - Add support for IPSEC rules on EXTERNAL_INTERFACE.
  - Add support for syn-floods, port scans and ping-of-death.
    + Need iptables > v1.2.6a for these two!
  - Faulty use of 'get_ip && error'. Should be 'get_ip || error'.

* 20060823
  - Can't call '/sbin/modprobe > /dev/null 2>&1 [module]'. Shell complains
    that '>' is an unknown module. Instead create the wrapper function
    load_module().

* 20051217
  - Don't add the STDOUT/STDERR redirect (to /dev/null) in the variable
    definition. It doesn't work that way, the module to load must be BEFORE
    the redirect. We do the redirect etc in a function instead.
  - Default netmask for the external network is 32 (one host).
  - No more internal netmask. We get that from the interface at the same time
    as we retreive it's IP address.
  - Support multiple internal networks...
  - Function get_net() added which extracts the network/netmask from an
    INTERNAL_IP variable portion. Defined as 'interface/ipaddress/netmask'.
  - Function debug() added which 'prettifies' the debug output.
  - Rename the chains() function to chains_external() which is more in line
    what the function does - adds rules to the EXTERNAL interface (only!).
    + Prettify the debug output using both debug() and echo at the right place(s).
    + Add support for DELETING the Brute Force rules.
    + Remove the 'whitelist jump table(s)' (AFTER the brute force rules have
      been cleared from the jump table(s)) when stop'ing the firewall.
  - Move the stuff that sets up (and removes) the rules on the INTERNAL interface
    to it's own function - chains_internal().
    + Same changes as done to the chains_external() function...
  - Support kernel version > 2.6, which module is suffixed with '.ko' instead
    of '.o'.

  Setup connection/authentication attempt limits.
  Idea taken from http://marc.theaimsgroup.com/?l=secure-shell&m=111565298029188&w=2
  - Add to firewall.conf:
    BRUTE_LIMIT="4:60"
    BRUTE_RULE="22:SSH"
    BRUTE_RULE="$BRUTE_RULE 8080:SQUID"
    BRUTE_RULE="$BRUTE_RULE 389:LDAP"
    BRUTE_RULE="$BRUTE_RULE 636:LDAPS"
    BRUTE_RULE="$BRUTE_RULE 88:KRB5"
    BRUTE_RULE="$BRUTE_RULE 749:KRB5Adm"
    BRUTE_RULE="$BRUTE_RULE 751:KRB5Auth"

    + The 'BRUTE_LIMIT' is 'attempts:within' (number of attempts within x seconds).
    + The 'BRUTE_RULE' is _what_ to put limits on

  - Some notes about this:
    These rules will be added AFTER all the local exeptions and all your
    friendly hosts will be added to a whitelist...

  - You will need to have the following netfilter options in the kernel (either
    as a module - recomended - or static inside the kernel):
    CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_RECENT	recent match support
    CONFIG_IP_NF_TARGET_LOG	LOG target support
    CONFIG_IP_NF_CONNTRACK	Connection tracking (required for masq/NAT)
      CONFIG_IP_NF_MATCH_STATE	Connection state match support
